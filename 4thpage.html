                Enrolment among women in STEM-related university programmes has stagnated over the past decade, with the causes of this disparity differing across industries and regions. If left unaddressed, however, it will compound reskilling challenges that are already expected to cost G20 countries more than $11 trillion over the coming decade.

Multiple inspiring stories have shown how these barriers can be broken. Ritu Karidhal, one of the "rocket women" of the Indian Space Research Organization has inspired a rise in the number of women pursuing STEM fields in India. And she is not alone: From Esraa Tarawneh’s work on mitigating flash floods that's helped multiple communities tackle one of our century’s largest environmental threats, to Ayanna Howard’s assistive technologies that are revolutionizing accessibility for children with disabilities, women are pioneering ground-breaking innovations.<a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/01/why-it-s-time-to-use-reskilling-to-unlock-women-s-stem-potential/">Read More</a>

                In 2023, researchers published a tremendous number of articles that confirm, interrogate, and confront the systemic injustices that impact women and girls in engineering and the STEM fields more generally. This collective focus underscores the importance of addressing gender inequities in STEM — which an encouraging number of practitioners and researchers are working to eradicate — and sharing models for creating change that others might adopt. This annual review aims to survey the variety of this research, while highlighting particularly salient examples of studies that convey important insights, especially insofar as they inform scholars, policymakers, funders, and practitioners interested in creating more equitable engineering ecosystems.

This review reveals differences in how researchers’ emphases have shifted since last year. In 2022 there was a preponderance of research interested in the COVID-19 pandemic’s largely negative effects on gender equity; in 2023, there were fewer of these studies. There are opportunities moving forward to further unpack the mechanisms through which the pandemic may or may not be contributing to long-term inequities. At the same time, the review of the 2022 literature discussed some themes that continued to be relevant in 2023. These include: the prevalence of gender stereotypes and their impact on women’s and girls’ interest and performance in STEM activities; efforts to increase diversity through an emphasis on either recruitment or retention; and interventions designed to increase gender equity in STEM.....<a href="https://swe.org/magazine/2023-lit-review/">Read More</a>

                In 2023, 78.3 million people in the EU aged 15 to 74 were employed in science and technology, indicating a 2.9% increase compared with 2022. When looking at 2013, data show a substantial rise of 25% in the last decade (62.5 million people). Science and technology occupations comprise those whose main tasks require either a high level of professional knowledge or technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of physical and life sciences, or social sciences and humanities. 

Of the 78.3 million people employed in science and technology, 52% were women (no change compared with 2021 and 2022). They worked predominantly in service activities (57% women versus 43% men). Malta was an exception, with only 48% of women in science and technology employed in service activities.....<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/w/ddn-20240613-2">Read More</a>

               In STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), one of the most significant obstacles that remain is gender disparity. Women are disproportionately underrepresented in STEM disciplines, according to research and statistical statistics. In comparison to men, women comprise a lesser share of the STEM workforce and are less inclined to pursue STEM-related degrees and jobs. A major detrimental impact on STEM creativity and diversity is caused by this mismatch, which narrows the spectrum of perspectives, approaches, and techniques for problem-solving. Varied ideas and solutions are more likely to be generated by a more varied STEM community, which would hasten the growth of science and technology. Diversity is crucial for fostering creativity.

Girls in STEM education are crucial because they not only foster diversity and creativity but also serve as important role models for future professionals. Their efforts serve as a catalyst for inventions that upend whole industries and pave the way for future generations. From the ground-breaking discoveries made by Marie Curie to the achievements of contemporary female scientists, engineers, and technicians, girls in STEM have always improved the field with their knowledge, ingenuity, and perspectives. In this regard, female participation is currently a major factor influencing the development of STEM fields and STEM education......

                This paper explores women's experiences, challenges, and triumphs in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields, focusing on efforts to break down barriers and promote inclusion within these disciplines. Despite historical underrepresentation and systemic biases, women have made significant contributions to STEM, driving innovation and advancing knowledge across various domains. However, persistent obstacles such as gender biases, workplace discrimination, and lack of support continue to hinder women's progress in STEM. Through initiatives promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion, there is a growing recognition of the importance of empowering women in STEM to address global challenges and drive progress. This paper examines strategies for fostering inclusive environments, promoting representation, and supporting the advancement of women in STEM, highlighting the critical role of diversity in driving innovation and creating a more equitable and sustainable future. Introduction: In the vast landscape of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the contributions of women have historically been undervalued and overlooked. However, in recent decades, there has been a notable surge in efforts to break down barriers and promote inclusion for women in these fields. From pioneering scientists and engineers to innovators and educators, women have been at the forefront of groundbreaking discoveries and technological advancements, challenging stereotypes and reshaping the landscape of STEM disciplines. This topic, "Women in STEM Fields: Breaking Barriers and Promoting Inclusion," delves into the multifaceted experiences, challenges, and triumphs of women pursuing careers in traditionally male-dominated fields. It explores the systemic obstacles that have hindered women's progress in STEM, ranging from cultural biases and gender stereotypes to institutional barriers and lack of representation. Moreover, it highlights the transformative initiatives and advocacy efforts to foster a more inclusive and equitable STEM community, where women are empowered to thrive and succeed. This paper aims to shed light on the importance of diversity and representation in driving innovation and addressing complex global challenges by examining the stories of trailblazing women scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and technologists. By amplifying women's voices in STEM and celebrating their achievements, we can inspire the next generation of female leaders and pave the way for a brighter, more inclusive future in STEM fields.....<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382946606_WOMEN_IN_STEM_FIELDS_BREAKING_BARRIERS_AND_PROMOTING_INCLUSION">Read More</a>
